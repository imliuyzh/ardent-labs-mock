# imliuyzh.github.io/ardent-labs-mock/#/
This repository contains my first-ever React project that attempts to clone [ardentlabs.io](ardentlabs.io). It is one of the four milestones that every intern must complete before they can move on to the next step. As for now, it is recommended to view the website in a traditional PC device because it is not responsive for mobile devices.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Running the Application
1. Install Node.js
2. Go to the directory in the command line you want to set up the application and clone this repository with `git clone`
3. Open the `ardent-labs-mock` folder and type `npm install` to do all the necessary work before you run this application
4. Type `npm start` to run. It should be running on `localhost:3000` unless you have other applications running simultaneously
5. Hit `Ctrl+C` to stop running

### Built With
- Node.js
- React (installed with create-react-app)
- React Router
- UUID
- react-router-hash-link
- react-scroll
- react-reveal

P.S. The whole application is written in Ubuntu 19.04 at the time of this writing.

## Versioning
I used only Git bash for version managing. There are a lot of great tutorials online that teach people about it.

## Acknowledgments
I want to say thank you to my fellow interns in Ardent Academy for their assistance. Also, kudos to Dr. Li for providing this amazing opportunity to let me work in Ardent.
