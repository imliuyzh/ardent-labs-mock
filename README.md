# [imliuyzh.github.io/ardent-labs-mock](http://imliuyzh.github.io/ardent-labs-mock)
This repository contains my first React project that attempts to clone [ardentlabs.io](ardentlabs.io). It is recommended to view the website in a traditional PC device because it is not responsive for mobile devices.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Running the Application
1. Install Node.js
2. Download/clone this repository to somewhere else and navigate to the folder in the command line
3. Open the `ardent-labs-mock` folder and type `npm install` to do all the necessary work before you run this application
4. Type `npm start` to run. It should be running on `localhost:3000` unless you have other applications running simultaneously

### Built With
- React
- React Router
- UUID
- react-router-hash-link
- react-scroll
- react-reveal

## Versioning
I used only Git bash for version management.

## Acknowledgments
I want to say thank you to my fellow interns in Ardent Academy for their assistance. Also, kudos to Dr. Li for providing this amazing opportunity to let me work in Ardent.
